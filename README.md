# Graded-Unit-2
This project was created as my Graded Unit 2 project.

It consists of the full design, implementation and testing of a standalone beer shop developped in Java, accessing a remote database developped in MySQL.

This project achieved the final grade of 85%.

NOTE: this project is currently not working when downloaded, the connection used to work with a remote database but it has since been deactivated. The project will be fixed soon.
